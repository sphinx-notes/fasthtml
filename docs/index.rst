Introduction
============

.. INTRODUCTION START

A Sphinx builder specialized for **fast incremental HTML** build.

The builtin HTML builder supports incremental build too, but it have to do a
lot of extra work to ensure document consistency (such as updating glob toctree,
updating index, etc.) The fasthtml builder **skips almost all operations that
slow down the build** and left only the necessary parts.

If you often need to edit and build Sphinx documents locally, and only want to
preview the parts you modified, the fasthtml builder will be helpful to you.

Getting Started
===============

.. note::

   We assume you already have a Sphinx documentation,
   if not, see `Getting Started with Sphinx`_.

First, downloading extension from PyPI:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install sphinxnotes-fasthtml

Then, add the extension name to ``extensions`` configuration item in your
:parsed_literal:`conf.py_`:

.. code-block:: python

   extensions = [
             # …
             'sphinxnotes.fasthtml',
             # …
             ]

.. _Getting Started with Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html
.. _conf.py: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

.. ADDITIONAL CONTENT START

Then you can run the ``fasthtml`` builder:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sphinx-build -b fasthtml <sourcedir> <outputdir>

For Makefile users, it is recommended to add the following lines to your
Makefile, to share ``outputdir`` betweens the ``fasthtml`` builder and the
builtin ``html`` builder:

.. literalinclude:: Makefile
   :language: make
   :lines: 25-

Then use ``make fast`` to run the fast HTML build.
